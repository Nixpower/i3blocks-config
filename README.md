My personal i3blocks configurations, dual-monitor setup!

Still a major work-in-progress, so expect me to add a lot of cool stuff to my configs.


# Setup

## Dependencies
The only dependency you really need is i3blocks, ponymix (if you plan on using `i3blocks-volume-pulse`), and youtubed (for the youtube downloader)

## What's in the repo?
The `config` is my `~.i3/config`. Take a look at it and modify the bar commands near the bottom to match your monitor setup. Modify the `.i3blocks.conf.*` files as you like, and the `i3blocks-volume-pulse` gives you volume access through ponymix. `weather.sh` is pretty self explanatory.


Thanks to everyone who made some of these fabulous scripts over at the i3blocks wiki!
